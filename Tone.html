              <p> Tone is a Titan class that is based on the Atlas chassis, with a focus on target-locking weapons and rockets. Her 40mm Tracker Cannon still fires semi-automatic explosive shots, but has been upgraded to acquire partial locks on hostile Titans. Her abilities include Tracker Rockets, which fires rockets at fully locked enemies, Sonar Lock, which reveals enemies in an area and establishes partial lock, and Particle Wall, which places a transparent wall in front of Tone that she can shoot through. Her core ability, Salvo Core, fires a heavy barrage of guided rockets, and will gradually orient toward any target Tone looks at. Targets with a partial lock cannot be fired upon with the guided rockets - a full, 3-ring-segment lock must be achieved for offhand weapons to fire.

            <p> Tone is a very effective titan in most combat situations. The 40mm Tracker Cannon does moderate damage against other Titans and can kill most pilots in one shot. It's tracker rockets can inflict large amounts of damage against all titans and can easily destroy its enemies in a short amount of time if manages to repeat this process enough. The Particle Wall can buy Tone a window of time for it inflict damage to other titans without suffering damage itself as Tone must expose itself in order to lock on to and fire rockets at enemies, the cover it provides is invaluable. Sonar Pulse can help scout out enemies that may be nearby and can help prepare for a coming battle or get the drop on an enemy, as well as granting a third of a lock-on. Tone's Salvo Core can inflict a massive amount of damage onto a single target as well suppress a group of enemy titans if outnumbered.

              <p>
                    Tone is most effective in medium range combat and is generally is ill-suited for close-range engagements against Titans such as Ronin or Legion. If cornered it recommended to dash out as soon as possible and try to repel them with the cannon and rockets. This strategy generally works well against Stryder and Atlas class Titans as they will take huge chunks of damage and at times will give players the opportunity to destroy them if they can inflict enough damage. Against one of the Ogre class Titans however, it is recommended to get a bit more distance or fall back if Tone's chassis is too damaged, as Scorch and Legion will normally have enough health to withstand any retaliatory damage Tone could inflict on them and can recover long enough to destroy Tone.
