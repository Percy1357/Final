              <p> Ion is a Titan class that is based on the Atlas chassis design. Laser-focused, Ion is all about power. With a central energy system that fuels all of its offensive and defensive abilities, the Ion is an effective, tactical force on The Frontier. Ion's primary weapon is a Splitter Rifle. The Ion has an energy bar that recharges slowly, and almost all of her attacks require using this bar (with the exception of un-split Splitter rifle and, if you have Zero-Point Tripwire, then deploying tripwire). Ion has relatively low damage, but its ability to take the place of almost any role on the battlefield makes this a good titan for beginners (hence the reason why it is first on the titan list, and why it is chosen for you at first.

            <p> Ronin is also a Stryder class titan and the fastest titan.  He has two dashes normaly plus his Phase Dash which makes him immune to any damage which can count as an extra dash plus they can equip an extra dash to have three plus the Phase Dash which is a Total of Four Dashes.  He is a hit and Run style Titan.  He uses a leadwall shotgun and a BroadSword which gives him extra Range than all other Titans</p>

               This is the intro Video to Ronin The Hit n Run Titan.  His Leadwall is very strong but only has Four shots till he has to reload.  One of his tools that makes him Fast is His Phase Dash to give him an extra dash.  His second tool can be used as a way to get closer to his enemies which is Sword Block which makes it so he can reduce any damage he takes by 75%.  His last ability is a way to start a fight which is Arc wave which shoots out electricity across the floor which damages, stuns, and breaks through any shields.
