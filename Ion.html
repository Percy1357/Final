              <p> Ion is a Titan class that is based on the Atlas chassis design. Laser-focused, Ion is all about power. With a central energy system that fuels all of its offensive and defensive abilities, the Ion is an effective, tactical force on The Frontier. Ion's primary weapon is a Splitter Rifle. The Ion has an energy bar that recharges slowly, and almost all of her attacks require using this bar (with the exception of un-split Splitter rifle and, if you have Zero-Point Tripwire, then deploying tripwire). Ion has relatively low damage, but its ability to take the place of almost any role on the battlefield makes this a good titan for beginners (hence the reason why it is first on the titan list, and why it is chosen for you at first.

            <p> The Atlas class Titan called Ion is all about Power and fullfilling multiple roles in the team.  All he abilities have an energy pool they all take energy from.  She has a vortex shield which is very usfull to block and send back all projectile bullets.  Ion has a total of one dash but can be upgraded to two with and extra kit. Her Primary weopon shoots plasma that can be split into multple shots but cause it to use energy.

               This is the intro video to Ion the Atlas class Titan she is a titan that can fullfill many roles in the team.  her defensive ability is vortex shield which allows her to catch and send back all projectile bullets but this drains energy per shot.  Her tactical ability is Zero-Point Trip wire which sets a trap that deals massive damage to anyone foolish enough to walk through it, it can be destroyed though and it waste a lot of energy but a kit can be equiped that allows this ability to not waste any energy.  Her last ablity her Ordinance is a lazer beam which can be held for percision aiming and waste some energy but not a lot but deals massive damage to any pilot and a good way to poke any enemy titan.
