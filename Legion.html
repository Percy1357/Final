              <p> Legion is a Titan class that is based on the Ogre chassis design, focusing on inexorable advances, dealing damage and controlling combat zones. He wields the Predator Cannon, which is equipped with short and long range ammo variations. His ordnance is known as Power Shot. While in short range mode, he fires a shotgun-like spray, which is great for taking out nearby pilots. While in long range mode, the shot is similar to the Plasma Railgun's projectile. The minigun is also equipped with a protective Gun Shield capable of absorbing a fair amount of damage.

            <p> Legion's cannon can deal tremendous damage at any range and the chassis can take a vast amount of damage in return, making it great for pushing lanes whilst attracting the enemies' fire. His Gun Shield can also provide much needed protection when taking fire or reloading. The titan's rate of fire, combined with the power shot, make for the highest damage potential of any titan in game. Switching firing modes takes time and can leave Legion open to attacks, especially at close range. It is best to switch firing modes while enemy Titans are at a distance.

              <p>
                    Legion specializes in both offensive and defensive combat in most situations. When fighting offensively, it is best to to initiate pushes as the first one into the fight, chewing through defensive abilities and working to expose Titans so Legion can inflict severe damage to enemies. Hidden Compartment or Enhanced Ammo Capacity are useful in emphasizing this role. When fighting defensively, Legion can be especially lethal when holding off enemies at long range, and his Smart Core can make short work of both Pilots and Titans trying to get close.  Based on the Ogre chassis, Legion is slow to react and move as his gun must first "spin up" before firing, as do most of his other abilities; care must be taken to plan your ability use. Much of this can be mitigated by equipping Turbo Engine, which provides much needed agility, and the ability to shift into and out of cover.
